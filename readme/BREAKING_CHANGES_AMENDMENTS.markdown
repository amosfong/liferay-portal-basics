LPS-196035 Avoid needing to regenerate after every screenName or emailAddress change. Use the immutable userId field for WebDAV access.

# breaking

## What portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/model/impl/UserImpl.java

WebDAV clients can no longer use the user's screen name, email address, or regular password when authenticating via Digest Auth.

## Why

WebDAV (or Digest Auth more generally) now requires each user to generate a separate password for this access, and it requires the user to take specific Account Settings UI actions to do so. Previously a simple web login would suffice. To avoid unexpected WebDav access rejections and simplify the user experience, now a userId is required.

LPD-15236 Add companyId argument to scope every request by companyId.

This is necessary because, given the following Object Definitions and companyIds:
    - C_Test & companyId 1
    - C_test & companyId 2

If we call the method with itemClassName = com.liferay.object.rest.dto.v1_0.ObjectEntry and taskItemDelegateName = C_test from a request in the companyId = 1, the method will return an instance of BatchEngineTaskItemDelegate, but thatshould not happen, as the C_test taskItemDelegateName is only defined in companyId = 2.

For that, in the following commits we need to scope by companyId all the BatchEngineTaskItemDelegates (if there is a companyId parameter, if not, it will be returned for all the companies)

# breaking

## What modules/apps/batch-engine/batch-engine-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/batch/engine/BatchEngineTaskItemDelegateRegistry.java

The method getBatchEngineTaskItemDelegate(String itemClassName, String taskItemDelegateName) is replaced with getBatchEngineTaskItemDelegate(long companyId, String itemClassName, String taskItemDelegateName).

## Why

Whether a taskItemDelegateName exists depends on the company, so BatchEngineTaskItemDelegate objects must also be retrieved with a company's scope.

LPS-199540 portal-impl: Remove portal property and add obsolete portal key to VerifyProperties

## Why

The index.permission.filter.search.amplification.factor property did not effectively improve permission filtering and it was only applied on the first search.

## Alternatives

The search amplification uses a better algorithm to speed permission filtering.
