Here's the template to use for each breaking change (note how it ends with a
horizontal rule):

### Title
- **Date:**
- **JIRA Ticket:**

#### What changed?

#### Who is affected?

#### How should I update my code?

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "World";

String s3 = "Hello World";

if (reverse) {
    s3 = "World Hello";
}
```

#### Why was this change made?
